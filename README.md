# Prodigy_ML_01
Implement a linear regression model to predict the prices of houses based on their square footage and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms. As  you can use Python with libraries such as pandas for data handling, scikit-learn for the linear regression model, and numpy for numerical operations.
I also attach dataset "House Price Prediction Dataset.csv"
